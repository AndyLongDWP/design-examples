# How to use

### Step 1 - The layout
Copy the file `layout-index.html` into your `app/views` folder. It should sit along side your existing `layout.html` file.

### Step 2 - The CSS
Copy the file `_layout-index.scss` into your `app/assets/sass/` folder.

Open your `application.scss` file and add the following line at the bottom:

```@import 'layout-index';```

### Step 3 - The index page
Copy the file `index.html` to your `app/views` folder.

Edit the default information in the index page to suit your prototypes.
